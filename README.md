# HTML and CSS Project: Tribute Website

This website is a **learning project website** I created to test my *HTML* and *CSS* skills. And also for people to see my development skills and experience.

For the development of this project, I will **only use** HTML and CSS, no libraries and frameworks. I will only use some coding tools and the Figma design file.

This project is developed under an **open-source software license.** Feel free to comment or send a message for details or other information.

```cli
    yarn install

To build the project for development purposes, starting a local server, run:

```
